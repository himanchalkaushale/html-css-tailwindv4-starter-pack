# Tailwind CSS v4 Starter Pack

This is a simple starter pack for Tailwind CSS v4.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/himanchalkaushale/html-css-tailwindv4-starter-pack
    cd html-css-tailwindv4-starter-pack
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Development

To start the Tailwind CSS watcher and compile your CSS during development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will watch for changes in `./style.css` and `./index.html` (as configured in `tailwind.config.js`) and output the compiled CSS to `./output.css`.

### Build for Production

To build your CSS for production (minified and optimized):

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile your CSS once and output it to `./output.css`.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: Your main HTML file.
-   `style.css`: Your input CSS file where you'll use Tailwind directives.
-   `output.css`: The compiled output CSS file generated by Tailwind CSS.
-   `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration file.
-   `.gitignore`: Git ignore file.
-   `package.json`: Node.js project configuration and scripts.
